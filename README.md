## System architecture

TODO: brief description of architecture.

## Setting up the development environment

1. Setup your preferred editor/IDE. I use Visual Studio Code with the ESLint extension, but any NodeJS compatible environment will do.

1. Install `node` version >= 10.0.0 and `npm` version >= 6.0.0. I recommend using `nvm` (Mac OS: `brew install nvm; nvm install 10; nvm use 10`).

1. Clone the repository at https://github.com/jfeferman/SearchMDB.
